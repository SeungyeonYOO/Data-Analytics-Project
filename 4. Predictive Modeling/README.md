# Binary Dependent Variable Modeling

The objective of the project is to identify how the different values of independent variables influence the probability of getting a certain outcome. We will be attempting to build a predictive model that predicts the outcome of the binary dependent variable (`participation`; yes or no) by investigating the relationship between the dependent and independent variables and estimating the marginal effect of each variable.

Furthermore, with the model built within the project, we will attempt to predict the outcome, and how likely a person would participate in the workforce in a hypothetical situation. (e.g. an x-year-old person with a log-non-labor income of y and z years of education, etc...)

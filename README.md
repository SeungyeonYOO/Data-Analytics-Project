# Data Analytics Projects

## 1. Econ 104 Projects
The projects in this repository is completed for Econ 104 class (Data Science for Economicsts) taught by Professor Kimberly Boswell. The course covers a variety of topics, including heteroskedasticity, serial correlation, instrumental variables, binary choice models, and regularization methods. 

The three projects were done by a group of 4 people, where I was responsible for processing and visualizing data, modeling, reporting the results in non-statistical terms.


## 2.  Interactive Dashboard
The Excel project is an independent project that I have done outside of school, which utilizes pivot tables to create an interactive dashboard for retail sales data.
